# James Harcourt
# Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
# Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().

name = "     \n\tJames\t\n   "

print(name)

print(name.lstrip()) # Strip Left
print(name.rstrip()) # Strip Right
print(name.strip()) #Strip left and right
